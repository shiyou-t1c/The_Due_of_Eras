Development Guide:

You need to understand the current urgent needs, which are the current work tasks. We release tasks in the form of meetings through Microsoft Teams communities. If someone wants to take responsibility, they can claim the task, just like picking up a quest in a guild in a game. You can join the community via the following link:

Download the Godot 3.2.2 fork project and clone the forked repository.
Create a new branch and develop on this branch.
Commit your code and submit a pull request for this branch.

The project consists of only one script, "b1.gd." Reading this script will give you a general understanding of the entire program.
The script primarily reads content from the "b1p/b1.tres" file:

1.Lines starting with # play a sound.

2.Lines starting with $ change the background.

3.Lines starting with ? provide choice buttons.

4.Lines starting with & jump to another branch (if empty, continue the current branch).



Currently, we need programmers familiar with the Godot 3.x engine, artists, sound designers, scriptwriters, and music producers. Of course, we are currently unable to pay any salaries. 

We don’t have strict working hours, and all decisions are made through voting. Therefore, everyone can contribute code easily without too much pressure. Even if you’re not a professional, you can still provide suggestions for the storyline.

### Plot summary

The empire of another world is blessed with abundant natural resources and thriving agriculture. The ruling class of the kingdom consists of old nobility, whose families have controlled most of the land and political power for generations. However, with the rise of overseas trade and the emergence of capitalism, a new merchant class and landed gentry have begun to ascend, eager to gain greater political influence and economic privileges. As a rising merchant, you participate in this era of profound societal change. 

### Requirements for Background

Difficulty Analysis: 
The price range for a single anime-style illustration might be approximately between $143 ~ $1286. Individuals willing to work for free for us may not exist. Contributors who can utilize large AI models for drawing to locally generate high-quality images meeting requirements (web-based AI generation might have copyright issues) would be highly welcomed. Currently, most people's GPUs are insufficient to support local AI text-to-image generation, which presents a challenge. The second challenge is that we require character design sheets, with consistent depictions of fixed characters across different scenarios. While separating character layers from background layers might facilitate AI generation, this approach could create lighting inconsistencies between characters and environments, potentially necessitating manual adjustments. No solution currently exists for this issue - those with potential solutions are invited to join our Microsoft Teams online meeting.

Artists may include their signature (artist name and artwork title) and date (completion date) in the corner of the image. However, these markings must not occupy too much space within the frame.All images must be clear with no obvious blurring, stretching, compression, black edges, white edges, etc.The background image must have a resolution of 1920*1080.Include attribution if using third-party assets.Third-party materials may involve copyright issues and are not recommended for use. It's best to obtain a license that allows free commercial use.）

### Requirements for Audio

Format & Quality:
    Must be in .wav or .mp3 format.
    No distortion, clipping, or background noise.


Content:
    Voice recordings must be clear, with proper pacing and enunciation.
    Music/SFX should match the tone of the scene (e.g., suspenseful music for tense moments).


Metadata:
    Label files clearly (e.g., SFX_DoorKnock_01.wav).
    Include attribution if using third-party assets.（Third-party materials may involve copyright issues and are not recommended for use. It's best to record your own audio or obtain a license that allows free commercial use.）


### Requirements for Script

The improvements to the program and the storyline mainly involve modifying the b1.gd and b1p/b1.tres files. If you have any suggestions, you can help us by submitting issues or pull requests.


### contact and networks

Although email is a convenient way to contact us, we also provide an online community for discussions and Q&A. We use Microsoft Teams—here’s the invitation link:
