#### Contributing  

Development Guide:

Download the Godot 3.2.2 fork project and clone the forked repository.
Create a new branch and develop on this branch.
Commit your code and submit a pull request for this branch.

The project consists of only one script, "b1.gd." Reading this script will give you a general understanding of the entire program.
The script primarily reads content from the "b1p/b1.tres" file:

Lines starting with # play a sound.
Lines starting with $ change the background.
Lines starting with ? provide choice buttons.
Lines starting with & jump to another branch (if empty, continue the current branch).



Currently, we need programmers familiar with the Godot 3.x engine, artists, sound designers, scriptwriters, and music producers. Of course, we are currently unable to pay any salaries. However, once the product is comparable to commercial products, we will need to build a fan base in the market. For sequels, we will switch to closed-source development and generate some income to sustain the project.

We don’t have strict working hours, and all decisions are made through voting. Therefore, everyone can contribute code easily without too much pressure. Even if you’re not a professional, you can still provide suggestions for the storyline.

### Plot summary

The empire of another world is blessed with abundant natural resources and thriving agriculture. The ruling class of the kingdom consists of old nobility, whose families have controlled most of the land and political power for generations. However, with the rise of overseas trade and the emergence of capitalism, a new merchant class and landed gentry have begun to ascend, eager to gain greater political influence and economic privileges. As a rising merchant, you participate in this era of profound societal change.
