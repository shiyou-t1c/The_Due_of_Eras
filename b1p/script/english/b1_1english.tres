The faint scent of leather and old pages filled the study.

The secretary of the Upper House gracefully entered the study, quietly approached you, and respectfully bowed.

Secretary of the Upper House: I hope to escort you to the nearest carriage; the meeting is about to begin.

? I won't attend the meeting.

The carriage is parked at the foot of the stone stairs in front of the mansion, drawn by sturdy white horses, with the body adorned with intricate carvings.

I entered the carriage with the House of Lords Secretary.

The carriage began to move, its wheels emitting a soft clatter against the cobblestone road.

I pondered, furrowed my brow, and my gaze settled on the secretary, my tone laced with a hint of doubt and unease: Why the sudden need for a meeting?

The House of Lords Secretary, avoiding direct eye contact with me while adjusting his gloves, said: "A blade poised to tear the kingdom apart. But whose hand grips the hilt?"

I produced a small bag of gold coins and placed it on the secretary's lap, whispering, "Who ordered you to tell me this?"

The secretary refused my bribe, so I withdrew the gold coins. He then added, "The Prime Minister wishes to discuss matters with you in private first."

I hesitated for a moment, in no hurry to respond.

Seeing my continued hesitation, the secretary added: "I believe this meeting will bring greater benefits to the Chamber."

?I'll go meet the Prime Minister

?I'll attend the meeting directly instead of seeing the Prime Minister

Me: "Am I standing where the blade is pointing?"

House of Lords Secretary: "The blade always points in one directionâ€”power."

At dusk, the sky was painted with soft hues of orange and purple.
